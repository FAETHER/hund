# Hund
A terminal file manager.
#### Goals
I want to learn new things. If you find Hund useful, it's a huge plus.
#### Current features
- Vimish command system
- Resize window
- File type recognition (indicated by color and symbol)
- Follow symlinks
- Move/remove/copy single file
- Create/move directory
#### UI
Hund uses dual-panel view just like GNU Midnight Commander does. And it uses ncurses too.
#### Be careful
Hund is very young at the moment and it can mess your files up if you trust it too much.
#### Commands
Commands are vimish
- `j` entry down
- `k` entry up
- `u` or `d` up directory
- `i` or `e` enter directory
- `cp` copy highlighted file from active view to the other view
- `mv` move highlighted file from active view to the other view
- `rm` remove highlighted file
- `rr` rescan and refresh active view
- `mk` create directory
- `TAB` change active view
- `qq` exit
- `ESC` reset command
#### Name
_Hund_ is a german word for _dog_.
